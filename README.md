# ðŸ“° NotePaper â€“ Newspaper-Inspired Notes App

NotePaper is a my first Next.js, Supabase project. I've learned using Cursor + Codex, pushing to Git and deploying with Railway and making it accessible via Https.
It is a desktop-first, black & white notes experience inspired by the typography of the *New York Times*. Built as a candidate-quality showcase for responsive UI work, Supabase integration, and modern Next.js 14 architecture.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Fully client-side Next.js 14 App Router** with strict TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Supabase Auth + Row-Level Security** to keep every userâ€™s notes private by design.
- **Markdown editor** with autosave, optimistic updates, and keyboard shortcuts for power users.
- **Infinite-scroll sidebar** with search, starred filtering, and NYT-like typography cues.
- **Toast notifications, optimistic CRUD**, and desktop-grade focus states for accessibility.
